===============

In order to run tests, use SameOurExperiment.py together with SameInvasiveEnvironment.py and ExperimentWrapperAgent.java. In these tests, the start states and the endogenous arrival numbers and probabilities are the same for every test round, so that reasonable comparison can be made.
For the original experiment file InvasiveExperiment.py and InvasiveEnvironment.py provided by the competition, the WrapperAgent.java can be used for testing.
